# Seal Club

A test project for getting me started on some simple TypeScript development. The idea of the game would be that you have
1) a seal, 2) a club, and then go party with those.

## Development

### Requirements

For this project you need to have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

### Installation

Type `yarn install` to install all packages that are required.
